# Pomodoro Timer

If you write a lot, you likely have experienced writing fatigue due to excessive long hours working. To combat this, Francesco Cirillo devised a technique called the [Pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) which breaks down long sessions into intervals (with breaks). This allows the brain to refresh itself and helps avoids burn-out. This works as follows:

1. Work (typically 25 minutes)
2. Short break (typically 5 - 10 minutes)
3. Repeat (3 times)
4. Long break (typically 25 - 30 minutes)
5. Repeat from Step 1

Zettlr simplifies this processing with a built-in Pomodoro timer.


## Using the Pomodoro timer
Access the Pomodoro timer by clicking on the circle in the top right corner of the screen, inside the Toolbar.

The Pomodoro timer, has 3 core settings that can be altered.

- The length of the **Work**, **Short Break** and **Break** duration's are adjusted by entering the desired time (minutes) in their respective text boxes.
- After each phase a **Sound Effect** is played. This are chosen using the drop down menu (Glass, Digital Alarm and Chime).
- The **volume of the chosen sound** is adjusted using the volume slider (fully left is no sound). This can be either dragged of clicked to chose the desired level (this also previews the sound at the selected volume).

> This is not your system volume, so if your system's volume is only at 20 percent, even a volume of 100 percent inside Zettlr will only sound as loud as 20 percent.

The timer is started by pressing the  **Start** button. The circle is then filled incrementally (in relation to the time remaining) with the color of the current phase (red for work, yellow for a short break and green for a longer break). Once the circle is filled, the next phase begins and an alert is played (presuming the volume is up).

To **Stop** the timer or simply review the current **status** of the timer, the circle is clicked again. A small popup shows the remaining amount of time for the current phase, the type of the current phase and gives the option to stop session.

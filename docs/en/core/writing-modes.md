# Writing Modes
In the View Menu, Zettlr features several Editor settings that may enhance your writing experience. Have a play and see what works for you!

## Night Mode
Also commonly known as 'Dark Mode', clicking this option will change the background colour of the Editor to black and the default text colour to white.

## Distraction-Free Mode
The distraction free mode removes visual clutter from the Editor environment. Zettlr opens with the [File Manager sidebar](file-manager.md) on the left side of the screen, showing your Workspaces and Files. If you now click on 'Distraction free' in the View menu, you will notice the sidebar disappear and your text content shift towards the centre of the screen.

In this mode, the sentence you're currently working on is highlighted and completed sentences are dimmed. Clicking anywhere on a sentence, shifts the cursor position and highlights that sentence.

By default, Zettlr does not hide the Toolbar in Distraction free mode. For those who prefer a truly distraction free app environment, a simple [Custom CSS fix](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/custom-css/#hide-the-toolbar-in-distraction-free) is available.

## Typewriter Mode
Typewriter mode is an extension of distraction free mode, in which the cursor position remains in a fixed position about midway on the page while the text you've written shifts up the page as you write, simulating the paper feed of a manual typewriter.

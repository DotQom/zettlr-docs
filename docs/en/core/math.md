# Math

Zettlr supports writing math and formulae using the KaTeX library. In order to use math, enclose your formulae with dollar signs (`$`). You can also use so-called "display math" by using two dollar signs instead of single dollar signs to enclose your formulae.

You can also define math blocks by putting two dollar signs on a single line before and after the math block. While inline math will have no syntax highlighting (except the formulae will be displayed using monospace font), such math blocks support syntax highlighting, making it easier to write more complex formulae.

Zettlr will immediately render formulae in place, making it easy for you to proofread what you typed and fix errors. If a formula contains an error, this will be shown by Zettlr.

For an overview of which functions and symbols you can use with the KaTex library, you can have a look on their documentation: [https://katex.org/docs/supported.html](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)

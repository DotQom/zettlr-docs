# Math

Zettlr supports writing math and formulae using the KaTeX library. In order to use math, enclose your formulae with dollar signs (`$`). You can also use so-called "display math" by using two dollar signs instead of single dollar signs to enclose your formulae.

You can define math blocks by putting two dollar signs on a single line before and after a math block. Anything detected as inline or display-math will receive proper MathTeX syntax highlighting.

If you activate the corresponding option, Zettlr will immediately render formulae in place, making it easy for you to proofread what you typed and fix errors. If a formula contains an error, this will be shown by Zettlr.

For an overview of which functions and symbols you can use with the KaTex library, you can have a look on their documentation: [https://katex.org/docs/supported.html](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)
